ZazuBot is fair source and can be self-hosted on your own server. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up your own instance of ZazuBot.

<Note>
  The easiest way to get started with ZazuBot is with [the official managed
  service in the Cloud](https://app.ZazuBot.com). You'll have high availability,
  backups, security, and maintenance all managed for you by me, ahmed, ZazuBot's
  founder.
  <br />
  The cloud version can save a substantial amount of developer time and
  resources. For most sites this ends up being the best value option and the
  revenue goes to funding the maintenance and further development of ZazuBot. So
  you'll be supporting fair source software and getting a great service!

| Hosting  | Easy and convenient. It takes 1 minute to start building your bots and share them with a worldwide high availability, backups, security and maintenance all done for you by me, [ahmed, ZazuBot's founder](https://twitter.com/ahmedkhaled4d). I manage everything so you donâ€™t have to worry about anything and can focus on creating great bot experiences. | You do it all yourself. You need to get a server and you need to manage your infrastructure. You are responsible for installation, maintenance, upgrades, server capacity, uptime, backup, security, stability, consistency, loading time and so on. |
| Storage  | All visitor data is exclusively processed on EU-owned cloud infrastructure. This ensures that your bots data processing complies with GDPR.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | You have full control and can host your instance on any server in any country that you wish. Host it on a server in your basement or host it with any cloud provider wherever you want.                                                              |
| Costs    | I charge a subscription fee. Whether you're a solo business owner, a growing startup or a large company, ZazuBot is here to help you build high-performing chat forms for the right price.

You never have to pay any fees to us.                                                          |

## Ready to self-host?

ZazuBot is composed of 2 Next.js applications you need to deploy:

- the builder, where you build your zazubots
- the viewer, where your user answer the zazubot

I've written guides on how to deploy ZazuBot using:

- [Docker](./deploy/docker)
- [Vercel](./deploy/vercel)
- [Manual](./deploy/manual)
- [ALibaba Cloud](./deploy/alibaba-cloud)
