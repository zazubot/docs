Credentials are used to connect ZazuBot to other services securely. These credentials can have 2 different scopes: **User** or **Workspace**.

User credentials are credentials that are associated with a user. Only you, as the user, can use them. It's useful when a user preference setting is required to use a service.

Workspace credentials are credentials that are associated with a workspace. They can be used by all members of the workspace. When you create a new credential in your bot, it will be created as a workspace credential by default.

You can view and manage your credentials by going to the `Credentials` tab in the `Settings & Members` menu.
